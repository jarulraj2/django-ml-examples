    <!-- Concept Explanation -->
    <div class="alert alert-primary">
        <strong>What is Unsupervised Learning?</strong><br>
        Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is not given any labels. 
        It tries to find patterns or groupings in the data on its own. A common technique is <strong>clustering</strong>,
        where similar data points are grouped together.
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <strong>Use Case:</strong> We've grouped customers into segments based on usage patterns, complaints, tenure, etc. 
        These clusters help us understand different types of customers â€” like high-usage, low-complaint vs. low-usage, high-complaint ones.
